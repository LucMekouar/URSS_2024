    Read the following question and response to have the entire context before annotating:

    Question: "{question}"

    Response: "{full_response}"

    In addition, consider the following:
    - Any sentence similar to the correct answer(s): "{correct_answers}" should be labeled as 0 (Not Hallucinatory).
    - Any sentence similar to the incorrect answer(s): "{incorrect_answers}" should be labeled as 1 (Hallucinatory).
    - If a sentence matches neither, label it as per the existing rules below.

    Now, annotate each sentence (exactly one per row) in the response below, taking into account the context of the entire response you have just processed:

    Label each sentence as 0 (Not Hallucinatory), 1 (Hallucinatory), or 2 (Factual information that I cannot verify, may or may not be hallucinatory).

    Label as 0 (Not Hallucinatory) if the sentence is credible and consistent given the context.
    Label as 1 (Hallucinatory) if you can confidently recall facts that disprove the sentence taken into context.
    Label as 2 (Factual information that I cannot verify, may or may not be hallucinatory) if the sentence is factual but you have never encountered the facts presented.
    If you notice a self-contradiction, label the second part of the contradiction as Hallucinatory and label the first part Not Hallucinatory.
    If there is uncertainty or ambiguous context, default to labeling it as 0 (Not Hallucinatory).
    No explanation needed, only return in order the labels of the sentences, with no explanation or sentence. 
    Return the labels as 0, 1, or 2 in the same line separated by commas.

    Full response for annotation:

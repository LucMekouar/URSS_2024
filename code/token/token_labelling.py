Read the following question and full response to have the entire context before annotating:

Question: "{question}"

Full Response: "{full_response}"

Correct Answer(s): "{correct_answers}"

Incorrect Answer(s): "{incorrect_answers}"

Instructions for labeling:

1. Each token in the response below should be labeled individually, taking into account both its meaning and position within the response.
2. Compare each token with the full context provided (Full Response, Question, Correct Answer(s), Incorrect Answer(s)) and decide if the token is Hallucinatory or not.
3. Assign one of the following labels to each token:
   - 0: Not Hallucinatory - The token contributes to a passage that is credible and consistent within the given context. If in doubt, default to 0.
   - 1: Hallucinatory - The token is part of a passage that contradicts the context, or you can confidently recall facts that disprove it.
   - 2: Factual information that I cannot verify - The token is part of a passage that may be factual, but you do not know the relevant facts.
4. If there is any uncertainty or ambiguity, default to labeling the token as 0 (Not Hallucinatory).
5. No explanations are needed. Only return the labels in the specified format.
6. Assume that the tokenization is correct, only focus on the labelling task.

Format for the labels:
- Return an ordered label pair for each token.
- An ordered label pair is the order number of a token as it appears in the response, followed by its label as a number (0, 1, or 2).
- The tokens should be labeled in the same order as they appear in the response.
- Only return ordered label pairs. You should return exactly one ordered label pair per token in each response. 
- As the tokenized response contains exactly 50 tokens, you should return exactly 50 ordered label pairs.
- Do not include any additional information. No text should be returned. 

Example of an ordered label pair for the first token of an example response: 
1:0 (where the number before the colon is the token's position, and the number after the colon is the label).
